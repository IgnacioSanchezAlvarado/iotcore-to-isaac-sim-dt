EC2 G6e.2xlarge instance with Nvidia Isaac sim environment (use this ami: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-bl35herdyozhw) that retrieves real robot sensors data from IoT core (have a look at handoff.md document). Have a look at this repo that contains USD robot scene and a source code for ros2 bridge into isaac sim: https://github.com/MuammerBay/so-arm101-ros2-bridge. The goal is to have the simulated robot arm reproducing the same real movements the robot is doing in real time by using the data received form IoT core topics. Everything must be deployed via CDK.
